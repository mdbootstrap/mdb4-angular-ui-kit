mdbInputValidate is used by default, but the user can disable validation by using the [mdbValidate]="false" control on input which contains mdbInputDirective.

mdbDeepDirective is used by default when used on a checkbox or radio. It is possible to disable it by using [focusCheckbox]="false" and [focusRadio]="false".

mdbRippleRadius was changed to mdbWavesEffect. mdbRippleRadius will be deleted after next release.
